## ‚úÖ Requirements to Installing the Application
<div align="justify">
In Delphi/VCL application, user need to configure the IPv4, user and password (in source code). This files are availabled in the folder src of project. Remember to recompile the EXE file after this changes. Note that EXE file (only running in windows machines) will read this informations, to call the web service. In the server side you need to run a http service with PHP and a MySQL Server. Remember to import the database.sql of database folder (that create all tables to DB) and to put login.php, insereIngresso.php and consultaIngresso.php in www folder of http service. Lastly, modify the admin and password variables of PHP to match of default user and password defines in MySQL server.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Community and Contributions to Future Work
<div align="justify">
Our major dreaming of this project, is that the community uses this magic tool to selling more (whatever kind of product you sell), like we achieved when we developing and apply our study case. But, we are open to new ideas to grow this project to the next level. With future work, that you can implement, we suggest a mobile version of Delphi (using FMX) of selling application. This will allow that every people of sales team, can sell using your cellphone.
